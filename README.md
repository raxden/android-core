# How is that

This project is created like a template to start another projets. It`s based in MVVM pattern with LiveData and Data Binding, besides use Dagger2 to injection dependencies, RX2 to reactive programing and Retrofit2 with OkHttp3 to HTTP layer.
        
### Project structure    

    app             - Presentation layer
    domain          - Business logic layer
    data            - Data access layer
    
    commons         - Contains util classes used by any module of project. Like a utils library.
    translations    - Contains files to translate application with Twine.

#### Module dependency

    app     -> commons
            -> domain
            -> data
    
    domain  -> commons
    
    data    -> commons
            -> domain
    
    commons -> no dependencies

### Flavours

    mock
    dev
    prod

All library dependencies configuration is located in buildSystem/dependencies.gradle.

### Steps to configure project

    1. Rename androidApplicationId and testApplicationId in /build.gradle.
    
        com.core.app -> com.yourcompanyname.yourprojectname

    2. To use Firebase in project, register application in Firebase and download|replace google-services.json 
    contained in app module. That proyect has n(flavours) diferences configurations. Therefore you must 
    register n(flavours) applications instead of one. For example:

        {androidApplicationId}
        {androidApplicationId}.dev
        {androidApplicationId}.mock
        
    Once this is done you will have to uncomment this line "apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'" 
    from app/build.gradle on bottom from file.

    3. To use Crashlytics, enter your keys in fabric.properties contained in app module. In addition you 
    must also apply the fabric plugin uncomment this line "apply plugin: 'io.fabric'" on top from file.

    4. Generate your release.jks keystore through AndroidStudio
    
        buildSystem/release.jks
    
    5. Defines your path to store pictures or files in device: (Replace package com.core.app by yours)

        dev/res/xml/provider_paths.xml
        prod/res/xml/provider_paths.xml
